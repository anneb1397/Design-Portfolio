                            My personal contribution to the codebase of this project revolved primarily around the RPG aspects of the game. I was responsible for designing and implementing
                            the levelling system, combat system and the internal skill tree of the player.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The combat system was the most significant contribution I made to the project and was the most fun to design. Our original design for this project featured the option of
                            having multiple types of the same attack, so when designing the combat system, I chose to implement it as an event-based feature.
                           
                            Whenever the base ability function was called, a Unity Event was triggered. This meant that any special upgrades or temporary bonuses could be added and removed to the call by modifying the Unity Event. 
                            It made expansion of the combat system simple and concise, without needing to modify existing features. It also allowed for a more versatile system that could be grown into a powerful combinatory tool. 
                            It was also important to me that the system performed well. I wanted a fast access time for the ability call, and with multiple abilities with different keys possible, I chose to store the keys being used
                            and the associated abilities within a dictionary. When a button was pressed, the dictionary accessed the associated ability in constant time and triggered the event.
